This project assignment is for development of end-to-end apps with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Vite and Supabase.

------------------------------------------------

1. Project Assignment

Using AI-assisted development implement and deploy a fully functional multi-page JS app.

1.1 The topic and scope of your project is up to you.

1.2 Examples: blog system, social network, listings website, hotel booking platform, issue tracking system, poll system, meme generator.

------------------------------------------------

2. Project Requirements :

2.1 Technologies
    • Frontend: Implement your app in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vite and Bootstrap. Use UI libraries and components of your choice. Keep it simple, without TypeScript and UI frameworks like React and Vue.
    • Backend: Use Supabase as a backend (database, authentication and storage).

2.2 Architecture
    • Use Node.js, npm and Vite to structure your app with modular components.
    • Use multi-page navigation (instead of single page with popups) and keep each page in separate file.
    • Use modular design: split your app into self-contained components (e.g. UI pages, services, utils) to improve project maintenance.
      When reasonable, use separate files for the UI, business logic, styles, and other app assets.
      Avoid big and complex monolith code.
    • Define project-wide "Agent Instructions" by creating the file .github/copilot-instructions.md in your repo (this is a mandatory requirement; create it if it does not already exist in the template) to provide architectural guidelines and project-wide instructions for the AI dev agent.
         The example content below provides the minimum required guidelines. You are encouraged to extend it with project-specific instructions:
         
         Example content of .github/copilot-instructions.md (minimum required):
             # Agent Instructions
             - Use modular design: split your app into self-contained components (e.g. UI pages, services, utils) to improve project maintenance.
             - When reasonable, use separate files for the UI, business logic, styles, and other app assets.
             - Avoid big and complex monolith code.
             - Use clear and consistent naming conventions for files, functions, variables, etc.
             - Write clean and readable code with comments where necessary.
             - Follow best practices for security, performance and accessibility in web development.
         
         You may extend the above with additional project-specific instructions, such as:
         - Naming conventions for your specific domain or entity types
         - Technology stack preferences and version constraints
         - API interaction patterns and data validation rules
         - UI component library standards or custom component guidelines
         - Testing and code quality requirements

2.3 User Interface (UI)
    • Implement minimum 5 app screens (pages / popups / others).
    • Example: register, login, main page, view / add / edit / delete entity, admin panel.
    • Keep different app screens in separate files (for higher maintenance).
    • Implement responsive design for desktop and mobile browsers.

2.4 Backend
    • Use Supabase as a backend to keep all your app data.
    • Use Supabase DB for data tables.
    • Use Supabase Auth for authentication (users, register, login, logout).
    • Use Supabase Storage to upload photos and files at the server-side.
    • Optionally, use Supabase Edge Functions for special server-side interactions.

2.5 Authentication
    • Use Supabase Auth for authentication.
    • Implement users (register, login, logout) and roles (normal and admin users).
    • Implement admin panel (or similar concept for special users, different from regular).
        • Admin users should have access to special features, for example to view all users, delete users, etc.

2.6 Database
    • Your database should hold minimum 4 DB tables (with relationships when needed).
    • Example (blog): users, profiles, articles, photos. Example (social network): users, posts, photos, comments.
    • Keep the database schema as DB migrations scripts in a local folder, for example in a `supabase/migrations/` directory in the project root.
      Name your migration files using a mandatory timestamp prefix in the format `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql` (e.g. `20240228120000_init.sql`, `20240228121000_add_profiles.sql`).
      The timestamp ensures that migrations are applied in the correct order, so keep the files in strictly increasing timestamp order (lexicographically sorted by filename).
      Example folder structure:
          - `supabase/`
            - `migrations/` (SQL migration files, e.g. `20240228120000_init.sql`, `20240228121000_add_profiles.sql`)
            - `functions/` (Edge Functions, e.g. `send_welcome_email.js`)
            - `storage/` (files for Supabase Storage, e.g. `profile_pictures/`, `product_photos/`)

2.7 Storage
    • Your app should store user files (like photos and documents) in Supabase Storage.
    • Your project should use file upload and download somewhere, e.g. profile pictures or product photos.

2.8 Deployment
    • Your project should be deployed live on the Internet (e.g. in Netlify, Vercel or similar platform).
    • Provide sample credentials (e.g. demo / demo123) to simplify testing your app.

2.9 GitHub Repo
    Your public GitHub repo is the most important project asset for your capstone project.
    The commit history in your repo demonstrates that you have worked seriously to develop your app yourself,
    and you have spent several days working on it.
    Without a solid history of commits in GitHub you cannot demonstrate
    that your project is your own work (not taken from someone else).
    • Create minimum 15 commits in GitHub.
    • Create your commits on at least 3 different days.
    • Optionally, you can create branches and merge them with pull requests.
        • Use meaningful commit messages that describe the changes you made in each commit.

2.10 Documentation
    • Generate a project documentation in your GitHub repository.
    • Project description: describe briefly your project (what it does, who can do what, etc.).
    • Architecture: front-end, back-end, technologies used, database, etc.
    • Local development setup guide.
    • Key folders and files and their purpose.
